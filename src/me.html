                    Mass Effect is a science-fiction RPG developed by BioWare for the Xbox 360, PC and the PlayStation 3.
                    This first part of a great space adventure was released in 2007. Lets talk about a most interesting and important part of this game, a story.
                    We dive in future where human race found ruins on mars which pushed the technological progress for hundreds of years ahead.
                    We play commander Shepard who in my case was raised in colony outside the Solar System and become soldier as part of N7 program.
                    Once he was sent on mission and his whole squad died on Akuze and he was the only survivor of this mission.
                    At the start of a game Shepard is on board of Normandy space ship with Captain Anderson a well known, respected military and 
                    turian Spectre Nihlus. Spectres are a special task group of a Galaxy Council and turians are one of the races we encounter.
                    Nihlus wants test Shepard to make him become a first human Spectre which is a great event in this world. However, the primary goal of this mission
                    is to transport o protean beacon from Eden Prime. This mission becomes more complicated because of atack on Eden Prime. Nihlus is dead, beacon is destroyed 
                    and almost everyone in colony is dead. This is how the plot begins. Shepard will have to prove the identity of atacker and stop him.
                    I will not say more because it will be a lot of spoilers. Throughout the whole game Shepard tries to stop his enemy and discovers 
                    the truth behind the disappearance of whole protean race. Mass Effect 1 is well know for his great story, rememberable characters and 
                    amazing lore of the world. This game is an epic adventure which started the most epic sci-fi history of all time. The next paragraphs will be obvious spoiler to previous
                    games so if you do not want any spoilers just leave it alone and check this series out.

            <h2 class="header2">Mass Effect 2</h2>

                    Mass Effect 2 is a second part of commander Shepard adventure. Once Saren and Sovereign were defeated citadel Council sent him to fight geth.
                    On this mission he is being atacked be the Collector Race. After some prologue event which I do not want to spoil Shepard will be co-operating with
                    a pro-human group called Cerberus which he fought in last game. This alliance is in good reason because whole human colonies are disappearing and only
                    Cerberus considers it as a threat. Shepard will start gathering a new crew and will try to solve this mystery. This part of series is more personal story.
                    The whole Suicide Mission is not the most important part of it but the story of each of companions. Let me tell one of them. One of Shepard's crew memeber will be a geth
                    who will be friendly to Shepard (even his crusade against geth in previous part). He will say that those were heretics who did not follow the rest of race.
                    In his personal quest we will have to decide if we want to reprogram heretics or just destroy all of them. It sounds like an easy choice but if we get to know with the whole situation
                    we see how tragic is fate of those machines, we realize that they were manipulated and they do not deserved such brutal fate. It is amazing how the directors of game
                    created a bond between a player and the characters. Mass Effect 2 is the start of the end which was comming...

                    Mass Effect 3 is the sequel to Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 developed by BioWare for the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
                    This game is a final chapter Shepard's journey, the final fight against the Reapers. They came to wipe out entry population of galaxy
                    and their harvest begins on Earth. Shepard will now not gather crew, he will gather whole species, armies and everyone he can ask for help.
                    Every decision we made in previous games matters and we will see their consequences. Every character we have met in previous games will appear on our screens
                    and we will see the end of their stories. It is the most epic of parts and it ends with huge space battle in which the war will be resolved.
                    This part of site is the shortest because I cannot say too much to destroy the whole experience.
