                    My hobby is playing various computer games. I love good stories in which I can dive. I will cover here 
                    few of my favorite games that are completely unique and must play.
                </p>

            <h2 class="header2">But it's just a game...</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    It is the most common sentence I hear every time I see older people talking about games.
                    Funny thing is that people does not say they same thing about books, films and other forms of culture.
                    As far as I am concerned It is harmful to them because they lose an opportunity to get to know with a lot of amazing stories
                    that would consume them, helped them forget about their problems and think about some great ideas hidden in those games. So let us begin our journey
                    through few my favorite games. To choose one of them just use menubar on the top.
